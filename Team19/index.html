			<h2>Solution for our project</h2>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;margin-bottom:0; color: #000000">
                The project is to build a system, which has cloud data
                exchange technique providing the users with information
                about the patients along with 3D data for complex surgical
                operations.
                <br>

            </p>
			<p style="text-indent:2em">
				So, we decide to use Maven to manage our repository , which actually is a Web App.
				And such app is developed by using React , and will be deployed through tomcat locally for development. 
                We also have a Hololens applicatin from the previous iteration of the project which lets you view the scans in minimal number of clicks.

                                              A medical repository which congregates patient data and allows a surgeon to send 3D models to a Hololens device.
                                              Aim - to improve the quality of surgical preparation by allowing surgeons to gain a better understanding of the task.

                                              The initial gathering of the requirements was done by meeting the previous handler of the project - Immanuel Baskaran.
                                              He provided us with the information that the client was looking for. After the initial meeting the project code was handed to us by the administrator.
                                              We then decided to meet the client who we will deliever the final product to - Shabnam Parkar.
                                              Before meeting the client we prepared some questions to ask some of them closed and other open questions.
                                              Most of the questions with answers have been listed below.

                                          Moreover to establish the user needs the potential users were surveyed.

                                          <p>
                                              The exisiting solutions provide the way to view CT scans on Hololens however, they do not offer the bespoke support that GOSH DRIVE is seeking.
                                              The ability to authenticate the person, view the data of different patients, filter specific scans and so on. These features can only be implemented by having a new solution.
                                              This doesn't mean that the solutions that are out there didn't help us. We were able to look at the design of the websites or in short the conventions that were used so that the same conventions are used within our system.
                                              Also regarding the viewing of the CT scans on HoloLens we will have to make sure the steps are easy to follow. So for example, you can use a website which lets you view the data but it does not have an option to view on the Hololens.

                                              We considered the alternative technologies that can be used instead of the HoloLens to view the 3D data.<br>

                                          <p>
                                              There were some technologies we found that could be possibly used in place of the HoloLens as aforementioned.
                                              However, it was due to the needs of the client that the HoloLens was taken forward as the final one. This was taken by factoring in the cost, the compatibility with the previous interation and support available.

                                          <p>
                                              The backend is basically composed of some restful api, which uses http requests to process the data.
                                              Objects processed by those api all store in the Azure Blob DataBase, and they are actually .mhif file format.
                                              Mhif file is exactlly xml file, but follow a detemined schema to building up. Each mhif file actuallu store one
                                              patient's information , and using an unique patietnId to label each patient.Restful api could analyisi those file and extract the
                                              information according to the http request from front end.

                                          <h5>Why Java Jersey</h5>
                                          <p>
                                              Using Java Jersey to build up the Restful Service have so many advantages, for example, the consumer only needs
                                              to know the URI of the root resource of the service, then they could boot from the root resourse to the required
                                              resource.And Java Jersey uses the Annoatatin Mechanism, so all HTTP-related parameter settings are implemented using
                                              annotations(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,etc). From @Produces(MediaType.Applications.JSON) i could return the json data to the front
                                              end, which is very convient and powerful.Also in this peoject, we need to parse xml file, in order to cooperate with DOM4J, which actually
                                              an efficient but a little bit complex xml parsing tools, java jersey could greatly reduce the complexity of the code.

                                          <h5>Why DOM4J</h5>
                                          <p>
                                              The mechanism of DOM4J is loading the whole xml file into a document tree in memory , and each node of the tree represent one element
                                              in xml file, so it is easy to operate the whole file, it supports deletion, modification, rearrangement and other functions,so the access
                                              efficieny is high. So for filtering the data, DOM4J is one of the best choice. One of the other alternative library is SAX xml parse tools,
                                              this one is applied to large XML documents, and in this project all the mhif file are very large, so this one also could be a good choice,
                                              unfortunately, sax only supports reading with low access efficiency, so that is not easy to retrieve information by using sax.

                                          <h5>	Why Azure Blob Storage</h5>
                                          <p>
                                              Since our project is a pipeline conversion for the Hololens_App project, and that project used the azure blob storage, so we must need to use the
                                              same database. The HoloLens app has been used from the previous addition while the bugs and errors due to the version change were fixed in this iteration so it ready to deploy.

                                      <p>
                                          After gathering all the requirements from the our client , we have built up a basic prototype to show how our respository
                                          interact with users. Such prototype include the details that the users requested us along with in response to the heuristic evaluation.
                                          Since our project is actually a web app staff ,  so we have to design an relative simple but functional user interface for users.
                                          Our team has used two types of evaluation to make sure the prototype is evaluated from both the user and the expert perspective.
                                          The diagram below is a basic prototype of our user interface.

                                          We used sketches to give ourselves an idea of how the design of the repository should look like at the very basic.
                                          Then the wireframes were created for the two main pages of the repository that will be used by users.

                                          <p>
                                              For the system architecture , we focus on the front end and the technology that makes it work with backend.
                                              <br>
                                              - The front end has been done in React which will allow the user to interact with the finished product with ease.

                                              This will also provide an way to visualise the data and to beam the 3D models on the HoloLens.
                                              <br>
                                              The backend will be completed in Java Enterprise which will allow features such as Pipeline conversion to be implemented.
                                              <br>

                                             This section provides a summary of the functionalities that makes the project stand out. The key functionalities include - 
                                              <ol>
                                                  <li>Dynamic Search Bar - lets you search using tags provided in the bar and gives you results dynamically.</li>

                                                  <li>Data Visualisation Grid - Shows the patient data on the webapp. The key point here is that you can change the schema of the data to be viewed in the patient file and that information can be viewed by using the same components. </li>
                                                  <li>Hololens Application - Used as a addon fron a previous iteration. The implementation that was here is that the libraries needed to be imported and the code needed to be made adaptable to that by changing some lines of the code. Also the Toolkits were re-imported as they had upgraded so that was another challennge that we overcame.</li>
                                              </ol>
                                          </p>

                                          <h5>Testing Strategy </h5>
                                          <p>
                                             The testing strategy we used for developing the API's for sending the data to the front end was the Test Driven development. 
                                              We started out by defining the abilities of the APi's and then wrote the tests that cover those functions one by one. As one test is writen we write the code to make it pass and move on to the next test until the implementation is completed. 
                                              This was sort of Unit testing as it tested each API if it has been correctly implemented. We used JUnit for this Approach. 
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              1.Unit testing:
                                              In unit test, we test the backend by using the Junit Library and JerseyTest , ResourceConfig library,
                                              during every unit test, ResourceConfig will try to get the resources returned by the interface, and in the unit test,
                                              we compare the returned resources with our pre-set expectations. If they are equal, the interface works correctly,
                                              and then we cover as much as possible input, making the test more credible.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              2.Integration testing:
                                              For integration testing, we connected the front end and backend and tested them manually to check if it gives the output we are looking for.Then we also connected it with the Hololens Application and did the integration testing using the Hololens Emulator to get the desired results. 
                                          </p>
                                        
                                          <p>
                                              4.Performance testing:
                                              The WebApp could dynamic search up to three conditions, so in this testing, we just test  different combinations of inputs and see how it took to get the results we are looking for and if the results are correct. For example, just as a reference we sent the patient case which contains two scans to the HoloLens App and it took about 6 seconds to achieve it. 
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              5.User acceptance testing: For this part of the project we asked some of our peers so that we are that the system is working and will be accepted by the client when we submit it on. However, this will be after this websit has been submitted. 

                                          </p>

The priority is medium as it does not affect how the user gets the information. </li>
                                          </ul>

                                          </p>
                                          <p> In section below we will focus more on the critical evaluation of the project within different subsections.
                                              <ul>
                                                  <li>User Interface/Experience - The project have a user interface which adds beenfit to the user experience by having a easy to follow structure. The search bar is dynamic which allows you to input tags using natural language for filtering the patient list. This helps with the user experience however, the ease of learning for using tags takes some time due to the limited visibility of the tags. Together with this, the patient data cells on the patient detail screen allow for multiple data variants to be displayed. On a critical note, it is difficult to scan patient details at a first glance as all of the details blend into one arising from a lack in visual variation.</li>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <li>Functionality - The front-end is low on functionality - there are few elements that the user can interact with aside from the search bar and the 'Beam to Hololens' button, while the patient detail tabs are functionally incomplete. Furthermore on the HoloLens application the model boundary box is difficult to control as a result of small control anchors.  </li>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <li>Stability - The webapp has a medium stability but however it could be improved by taking a more rigourous testing approach that we were not able to, due to limited time. The HoloLens Application however is stable in terms of performing the functions it does since it has been tested in the prvious iteration along by us. </li>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <li>Efficiency - The webapp has near to medium efficiency if it was to be rated from low to high as the functions on the how the data is parsed by using the backend. Using XML binary format will certainly help.  </li>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <li>Compatibility - The front-end was developed in a modular structure to ensure that components can be altered without affecting parent components and the compatibility of the overall project. The compatablity of the HoloLens App proves to be high since it is being used with a different project this time around. </li>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <li>Maintainability - Our backend uses simple modules which can be easily understood and maintained, but the front-end code lacks explainer comments and can come across as complex. </li>
                                                  <br>

                                              </ul>

                                                        Future Work
                                                        
                                                           - Possibly have the Meshpro app closely linked with HoloRepository. <br>

                                                           - Use Binary XML for MHIF files for performance boosts.<br>

                                                            -Take screenshots in the HoloLens app of a specific scan area.<br>
                                                            - For the front-end specifically add more functionality by combining the app from the previous iteration into. 
                                                        
                                                    </ul>

                                          Legal Issues
                                          <p>
                                              The project is the implementation of the NHS/GOSH DRIVE Holorepository with
                                              different tools for 3D viewing of models on HoloLens and storing data in cloud
                                              storage accessible anywhere. The project is from a legacy codebase which means
                                              that the project was in a partly developed stage when handed to us by the client’s
                                              team.
                                              The project involves sensitive data of patients which must be stored securely. To
                                              make sure that the data is accessed by authenticated users only, a login page layer
                                              will be put in place. With a software project involving data processing comes the
                                              liability of processing it correctly.
                                              <br>
                                              The end product will be used to plan patient’s surgery, so it is important that there
                                              are no defects within software for e.g. not displaying all the required details in the 3D
                                              holographic image properly. If there is such an error, then the developer could
                                              possibly be liable for that. However, since the project is only at one of its several
                                              iterations it should be thoroughly checked by the client and client’s development
                                              team using acceptance testing to look for any errors that could have a lasting impact.
                                              Therefore, as with the previous iteration there is a limitation of liability which restricts
                                              me and my team to be liable for anything excluding negligence by us. This is stated
                                              in the License of the project which limits the developer to accept any liability for the
                                              product user as a condition. This software and code are not guaranteed safe to use
                                              in a clinical or other environment and you should make your own assessment on the
                                              suitability for such use as stated in the conditions.

                                              The intellectual property or IP allows one to protect their work and there are different
                                              types of protection properties available, for e.g., copyright and Trademarks. The
                                              types are split into two sections – automatic and manual protection, which means
                                              your work is protected automatically or not depending on what work it is.
                                              The intellectual property type for this project is the copyright which is automatic. The
                                              property is copyright because the type of work created/developed is web content.
                                              However, if the name of the project was to be registered it will be Trademark and will
                                              have to be done manually by submitting an application.
                                              The copyright property has also been specified in the License document which has a
                                              condition that a copyright notice must be given.
                                              The Holorepository for GOSH DRIVE is an open source project which means that
                                              the source code is available to everyone in the community to access. To progress
                                              with this iteration of the project, we have and will be using other open source
                                              components. To make the front end of the Holorepository, React (JavaScript library)
                                              has been used for user interface. The React library uses MIT License (more on
                                              licensing later) that’s the react code remains under MIT License but can be used in
                                              another project license. The other component that the project uses is the SMART on
                                              FHIR, an open source apps platform for electronic health records (EHR) to access
                                              data smartly. This component uses Apache License, Version 2.0 which is a
                                              permissive license and doesn’t really impose restrictions, but you must specify the
                                              license in your work.
                                              <br>
                                              These components have been derived into the current project. The source code
                                              agreement that is in place is Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3.0 and hence,
                                              any components used will go under this license, while anything that will be derived
                                              from this project must also be under AGPL v3.0. There are different types of source
                                              code agreement and the type used depends on how much freedom the user should
                                              be given in terms of using it, modifying, redistributing and commercial use.
                                              The License I suggest for this project is the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
                                              because the license gives users the freedom to use it, modify, redistribute, private
                                              and for commercial use while the work stays open source even when used as a
                                              server software. You must publish the new code under same license. The
                                              suggestion has been made because the project is being developed as an open
                                              source for the NHS and it should stay open source for the community to continue to
                                              make changes and improvements. The other important reason is that the project is
                                              being derived from legacy codebase which is licensed under AGPL v3.0, so the new
                                              project must be under same license, as well as because the software will be hosted
                                              on a server. This protects it.
                                              It shall be noted that AGPL is a strong copyleft license which gives freedom while
                                              work stays copyrighted and is also compatible with other licenses such as Apache
                                              2.0.
                                              <br>
                                              The other accepted license is MIT license. This license is very simple from all and
                                              allows anyone to use the code and modify it, distribute, commercial use without
                                              disclosing the source. However, you only have to use same MIT license in place.
                                              This license is not suitable as the distributor doesn’t have to give source code under
                                              this, meaning if you want to include modifications someone has made you will not
                                              have the code. Hence, the project will benefit if it stays open source. Even the
                                              GeneralPublicLicense(GPL) is not suitable as it does not protect your work if hosted
                                              on a server.
                                              The General Data Protection Act(GDPR) which replaces the data protection act
                                              came into effect in 2018 with revised definitions. It has a huge impact on the project I
                                              am working on as it manages and processes data. The project is based on
                                              processing patient’s data which includes personal data. Therefore, the data privacy
                                              must be considered so that GDPR requirements are fulfilled.
                                              The project needs to comply with GDPR by taking several measures including by
                                              design and transparency etc. The data that’s processed shall only be the required
                                              data and processed in a lawful and fair manner. That is, if you did not say in the
                                              privacy notice you were going to do X with data then you should not do it, as the
                                              purpose of the data collected was not transparent to users. The logic of how the data
                                              is processed shall be transparent.
                                              <br>
                                              The data shall also be processed in a secure way and kept in identifiable form no
                                              longer than necessary. That is, there should be a retention policy so that the data is
                                              destroyed when no longer needed. The data subject should be able to erase any
                                              inaccuracies and be able handle their data of their lawful interests. The subject can
                                              claim for compensation if unauthorised disclosure, inaccurate data and for loss or
                                              destruction of data.
                                              To protect the data for this project it will be password protected and encrypted so
                                              only authorised users only have access to data with certain permissions. Since the
                                              data will be used from GOSH it will need to be transmitted in a secure way. To
                                              further comply with GDPR any breaches should be reported.

                                      On your desktop/laptop, head over to https://hololens-webapp-190422163731.azurewebsites.net/#/. You will be presented with the Holorepository homepage containing a patient search bar.
                                      <br>

                                      <br>
                                      The search bar acts as the primary entry point for the web app and you’ll use this to retrieve patients and filter through their details.
                                      <br>

                                      We developed the search bar to be dynamic, meaning natural language queries are processed and categorised in real time as you type. The filter categories include:
                                      - Gender - Male, Female.
                                      <br>
                                      - Age - 0-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-99
                                      <br>
                                      - Scan Type - current patient examples include Lungs, Skin, Urinary and Heart.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Simply type in your filter term and hit Enter. Results should now be visible below the search bar.

                                      Clicking ‘View Profile’ on a patient card takes you to the patient detail screen containing key information.

                                      The top half of the detail screen is dedicated to patient data while the lower half is reserved for a list of scans that are available to be beamed to a HoloLens.

                                      Selecting ‘Send to HoloLens’ triggers a background method which transfers the chosen model to the device.
